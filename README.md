## About Me 🗞️:
I just counted `67 mangos rolling` across my kitchen floor and one of them winked at me while whispering `“mustard is the key to enlightenment,”` and I swear `Kendrick` appeared in the corner with a tiny espresso, nodding like he knew the prophecy of the `dragonfruit` apocalypse. Meanwhile in `Naples`, some guy is aggressively tossing prosciutto onto a guava because apparently that’s peak Italian brainrot, and I can’t stop thinking about it because also there are 67 tiny jars of truffle `mustard` stacked like the Leaning Tower of Pisa on my windowsill. I tried to meditate, but a `pitaya` fell into my soup and now my brain is negotiating existential contracts with a `cantaloupe` wearing sunglasses. Someone yelled `“67 times!”` and I think it was the basil, but it could have been the Kendrick CD spinning on repeat. The `mangoes` are `plotting`, the `mustards` are `conspiring`, and somewhere, a lone fig is learning `karat`e for self-defense against rogue kiwis. I poured `olive oil` over a rambutan and suddenly it spoke Italian and started reciting `Dante` while juggling `67` pistachios. My cat just rolled over like it doesn’t care, but I know deep down it’s studying the sacred `geometry` of `passionfruits` and tiny `mustard` packets.
> More Info 📄:

Also, why is there a `mandarin` in my toaster? Did `Kendrick` put it there? Did the `dragonfrui`t summon it? I don’t know. Somewhere in `Sicily`, someone is painting a mural of `67 mangos` fighting `67 mustards` in slow motion while a `baguette` orchestra plays `Beethoven` backwards. My weenus has officially melted into a risotto of `guava`, feijoa, `mango`, `mustard`, and existential dread. And yet… I reach for another `mango`... `Kendrick` whispers, “Do it.” The `pitaya` winks. `Daquavous Pork` and `John Pork` intensifies. I have never felt more connected to the chaotic `fruit` cosmos. `67` more `mangos` appear out of nowhere, the `mustard` jars start breakdancing, and I swear I just saw a `kiwi` and a `rambutan` start a podcast about the philosophy of `Knee Surgery`.


## Programming & Stuff 💻: 
 \
Hi, I do typically program in `Java☕` 😱:
```
//Some Simple Java
public class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        final String HELLO = "Hello World!";
        hello(HELLO);
    }
static String hello(String Hello) {
    return Hello;
  }
}
```
\
\
Heres `something🧱` for fun 😡:

```
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        fun();
    }
  static void fun(){
    String Letter = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, "Type the following letter \'L\'");
    
    System.out.println(Letter);
        
    if (Letter.equalsIgnoreCase("L")) {
      
      JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(null, "Yes", "Click \'Yes\'", JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE);

      while (true) {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "YOUR COMPUTOR HAS A VIRUS!", "VIRUS DETECTED", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);
        
      }
      
      } else {
      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "You think your funny");
      fun();
      }
    }
  }
```
